Containment Procedures: Due to SCP-4321's self-
concealing nature and physical properties, physical
containment of SCP-4321 has been deemed impractical. GPS.
locating devices have been placed on SCP-4321 for
monitoring purposes. Foundation personnel are to intercept
any aircraft approaching SCP-4321. Satellite imaging of the
earth is to be intercepted and edited to remove appearances
of SCP-4321,

 

Samples recovered from SCP-4321 are to be stored in
standard organic anomaly containers, and are only to be consumed under testing conditions. Operations to retrieve
additional samples must be approved by the 5 council

A disinformation campaign is underway to convince the general population that dreams of flight are common occurrences.

Description: SCP-4321 is an immense landmass that maintains an altitude of approximately 7km above sea level. Itis
shrouded in a thick fog, thus appearing similar to a large cloud to outside observers, SCP-4321 has been known to move in a
similar manner to non-anomalous clouds, but over time has been observed to make slight deviations from predicted
trajectories.

GENERAL NOTICE 001-Alpha: In order to prevent knowledge of SCP-001 from being leaked, severalino false SCP-
001 files have been created alongside the true feffiles. All files concerning the nature of SCP-001, including the
decoyldecoys, are protected by a memetic kil agent designed to immediately cause cardiac arrest in any
nonauthorized personnel attempting to access the file. Revealing the true nature/natures of SCP-001 to the general
public is cause for execution, except as required under I iI a

Item #: SCP-3956

‘Object Class: Euclid

‘Special Containment Procedures:

 

t least one member of MTF Mu-33 ("Show-goers") must be present at all showings of

‘musical productions in London's West End. If SCP-3956 manifests the theatre is to be sealed off until all mealworms have
been removed and all civilians inside have been amnesticised.

‘The acting leader of MTF Mu-33 will decide whether or not an attempt to capture SCP-3956-2 will be made based on the risk
of civilian casualties.

All Foundation personnel investigating SCP-3956 are to wear noise-canceling earmuffs.

Description: SCP-3956 is an event that manifests in theatres found in the city of London. Thus far, SCP-3956 has only been
observed during performances of musical theatre.

‘The event lasts an average of 15 minutes and is identifiable by the following occurrences:

In the second act, an actor will sing an unscripted solo about mealworms for 2-3 minutes. The opening line is always,
“Mmm, tasty mealworms”.

During the solo, audience members who hear the song will be affected by an anomalous phenomenon. Several
‘mealworms? will emerge from the ears of affected individuals; these mealworms will then approach the stage. In later
‘manifestations, at least 1 mealworm will remain in the individual's ear.

At the conclusion of the mealworm song, the actor will gather and consume the mealworms on-stage. This typically
takes approximately 10 minutes.

‘Once all mealworms are consumed the audience will applaud and the show will continue as normal.

Individuals who hear the mealworm song live, designated SCP-3956-1, do not perceive the event as unusual and will instead
teact to SCP-3956 as though it is a normal part of the show.

‘SCP-3956-2 is a 2.1-metre-tall humanoid entity composed entirely of mealworms. It first appeared during the third
‘manifestation of SCP-39567. Following this appearance, additional recurring events pertaining to SCP-3956 manifestations
have been noted. SCP-3956-2 now enters the stage at a seemingly random point during the second act and will perform the

Special Containment Procedures

SCP-5908 is held within Safe Storage Locker 18 at Site-51. Under no circumstances is the testing of
SCP-5908 permitted.

Foundation assets in the field of historic academia are to support the theory that Dorian Lockley
was responsible for the assassination of Henry Clay. Any civilian attempt to exhume or study Henry
Clay's body is strictly prohibited.

 

 

SCP-5908 is a half-stock, muzzle-loading percussion pistol, created by Philip Creamer on behalf of
the 7th President of the United States, Andrew Jackson. SCP-5908 was designed with
thaumaturgic runes along the barrel capable of triggering a ritual upon firing of the weapon.

SCP-5908 was delivered to the Jackson Residence six days after Andrew Jackson's death and
remained unused until recovered by the Foundation.

 

Discovery

On 2020/01/20, SCP-5908 was acquired in a raid on an anomalous antique dealer's warehouse,
along with 26 other anomalous artifacts. A title card attached to SCP-5908 read, "Andrew Jackson |
Creamer Pistol, 1845", though no further information on its anomalous properties were available.
The Foundation has yet to discover the location of the compound's owner, Antonio Burelli(POI-
45Y67) and the investigation into his whereabouts is currently ongoing
