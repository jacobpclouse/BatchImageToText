you are skilled in salary negotiations. My clients have tried
every technique and have successfully used the answers in this
book to land terrific jobs. If you find marketing yourself
difficult, be comforted to know that it does not come easily to

hiring managers. I’ve given hundreds of speeches and appeared
on many TV and radio shows to share the insights in this book,
